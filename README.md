# Lizitt Unity3D Utilities

## Overview

This project implements various useful utilities for [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/unity) projects.

Status: Alpha  
Language: C#  
Target: Unity3D 5.0+ (Personal & Professional)

Unit test coverage not yet complete.

## Installation

Download the project and drop the contents of the `Source` directory into the Unity Assets folder.  No pre-built DLLs are planned for this project.

The directory structure is organized to allow you to more easily pick and choose the 'modules' you want, with the directory names indicating dependancies.  If you don't want a module, just don't copy its directory to your project.  For example:  Core has no dependancies.  CoreComponents is dependant on Core. 

## Documentation

There is no online documentation at this point.  But all code is documented using standard C# XML comments.

## Miscellaneous

All elements are located under the `com.lizitt.u3d` namespace.
